# ðŸ“¡ Customer Churn Prediction (Telecom)

This repository contains a complete end-to-end data science project that predicts whether customers will churn (i.e. cancel their subscription) for a telecom company based on historical usage, services and account data. It follows industry best practices and can be used as both a **learning resource** and a **portfolio project**.

## ðŸ§­ Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Predict which customers are likely to churn so that the business can **proactively retain them**, reducing customer attrition and maximizing revenue.

**Use Case:**  
Telecom customer churn is a critical business problem. Losing a customer is often more expensive than keeping one, and identifying high-risk customers allows companies to personalize retention strategies.
