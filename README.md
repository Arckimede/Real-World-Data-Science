# Level 2 Data Science Projects

Welcome to my **Level 2 Data Science Projects** repository! This collection showcases **intermediate machine learning projects** that go beyond simple tutorial notebooks. Each project demonstrates real-world data handling, structured workflows and end-to-end machine learning pipelines.

## 🚀 About This Repository

At **Level 2**, the focus is on:

- **Working with messy, real-world datasets** – not just clean Kaggle CSVs.  
- **Structured project organization** – modular scripts for preprocessing, feature engineering, training and evaluation.  
- **Robust modeling practices** – proper train/validation/test splits, handling imbalanced data, hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Documentation & reproducibility** – clear README files, reproducible workflows and exploratory data analysis.  

These projects are designed to show proficiency in **Python, pandas, scikit-learn** and common data science tools, preparing for **entry-level data science roles** or the transition to Level 3 ML engineering.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1. **Customer Churn Prediction**
Predict which customers are likely to leave a telecom company using demographic, account and service usage data.  
- Key skills: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, imbalanced classification 
- [Project Folder](Telco-Customer-Churn/customer-churn/)  

### 2. **Online Retail Analysis**  
Analyze transactional data from an online retail store to uncover purchasing patterns, segment customers, and identify revenue opportunities.  
- Key skills: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, visualization  
- [Project folder](OnlineRetail/data/)

### 3️. **OpenAQ Air Quality Prediction**
Predict air pollutant concentration levels (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, O₃) across different countries using **OpenAQ’s global air quality dataset**.  
This project goes beyond EDA to build a **full ML regression pipeline** — from raw data cleaning to model comparison and saving.

- Key Skills: Feature engineering, regression modeling, scikit-learn pipelines, model evaluation  
- [Project Folder](OpenAQ/data/)
