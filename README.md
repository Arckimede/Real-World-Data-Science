# Level 2 Data Science Projects

Welcome to my **Level 2 Data Science Projects** repository! This collection showcases **intermediate machine learning projects** that go beyond simple tutorial notebooks. Each project demonstrates real-world data handling, structured workflows and end-to-end machine learning pipelines.

## 🚀 About This Repository

At **Level 2**, the focus is on:

- **Working with messy, real-world datasets** – not just clean Kaggle CSVs.  
- **Structured project organization** – modular scripts for preprocessing, feature engineering, training and evaluation.  
- **Robust modeling practices** – proper train/validation/test splits, handling imbalanced data, hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Documentation & reproducibility** – clear README files, reproducible workflows and exploratory data analysis.  

These projects are designed to show proficiency in **Python, pandas, scikit-learn** and common data science tools, preparing for **entry-level data science roles** or the transition to Level 3 ML engineering.
